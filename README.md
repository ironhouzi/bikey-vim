bikey-vim
=========

Small plugin for managing bilingual keyboard layouts for Vim in a KDE environment. It allows for the posibility to change to a non-English layout, but only have it take effect during insert mode, allowing a sane interface to the normal mode commands during non-English typing sessions.

##Todo
- [x] Disable when running Vim remotely.
- [x] Works on plasma5.
- [ ] Disable when opening a read-only buffer.
